# IgniSign Examples

Welcome to the repository of IgniSign examples! This resource provides practical examples to help you integrate IgniSign into your applications effectively.

Currently, our collection includes:
- **Front-end Example**: An application demonstrating the use of the IgniSign JavaScript library.
- **Back-end Example**: An application showcasing the IgniSign NodeJS library.

These projects are designed to work in tandem, offering a comprehensive view of both front-end and back-end integrations. However, they are also adaptable for standalone use.

For detailed instructions on how to implement these examples, please refer to the `README.md` file in each project's directory.
